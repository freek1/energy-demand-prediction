inbound_loads
- remove cancelled (and VOID) rows, useless as doors do not open and cold is not lost
- Choose interesting columns for regression

outbound_laods
- remove cancelled and VOID rows, useless as doors do not open and cold is not lost
- Choose interesting columns for regression

demand_kWtrain_val
- split data in train and test

weather
- find out what columns mean
    - datetime_UTC = time at zone +0
    - datetime = time at local area (America)
    - hour = hour of time at local area.

Pallet_history_Gold_Spike
- find out how we should use this data. Is it useful for regression?

MAIN
- set all datetime objects to the same form. Now they can share the same axis.

- Maybe add more columns or remove some?
- Find out where NaNs come from when adding weather.csv in the final merge.
- Pick model more intelligently (e.g. other than AdaBoostRegression)
- Maybe more preprocessing? E.g. log of the time numbers or removing time 
- Maybe k-fold for hyperparams?
- When content with train MSE, regress on validation set.
- Report why some columns were removed. 
- Explain modification of data.
- Modify weather data: instead of merging, add the weather when there is an inbound/outbound truck to that row of data.
- omg, maybe combine inbound and outbound as the same thing: a time when energy is lost. 
  might not work, as inbound trucks have temperature data, outbound does not.
- add format when converting string to datetime object

- maybe PCA
- check if times are correct
